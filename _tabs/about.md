I’m **Clyde Quiber**, a cybersecurity practitioner with a strong interest in **Security Operations (SOC) and Blue Team defense**, alongside hands-on experience in **penetration testing fundamentals**. I come from an IT and networking background and focus on building practical skills through labs, CTFs, and self-driven security projects.

My interests include alert triage, log analysis, incident investigation, and understanding attacker behavior from a defensive perspective. At the same time, I apply penetration testing techniques to better understand how systems are attacked, which helps me think more effectively from a defender’s point of view.

I enjoy breaking down security events, mapping activity to frameworks like **MITRE ATT&CK**, and continuously improving my technical depth through both defensive analysis and offensive security practice.

This website serves as my technical journal, where I document my learning, labs, projects, and progress across security operations and penetration testing as I continue to grow in the cybersecurity field.
