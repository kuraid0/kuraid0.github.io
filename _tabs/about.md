I’m **Clyde Quiber**, a cybersecurity practitioner with a strong focus on **Security Operations (SOC) and Blue Team defense**, supported by hands-on experience in **penetration testing fundamentals**. I come from an IT and networking background and build practical skills through labs, CTFs, and self-driven security projects.

My interests include alert triage, log analysis, and incident investigation, with a focus on understanding attacker behavior from a defensive perspective. I also apply penetration testing techniques to better understand how systems are attacked, allowing me to think more effectively as a defender.

I enjoy breaking down security events, mapping activity to frameworks such as **MITRE ATT&CK**, and continuously strengthening my technical depth across both defensive analysis and offensive security practice.

This website serves as my technical journal, where I document my projects, labs, and learning as I continue to grow in the cybersecurity field.
